# damaged

The damaged event triggers after an actor has been damaged.

```lua
--- @param e damagedEventData
local function damagedCallback(e)
end
event.register("damaged", damagedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: Notify the player that their arrow/bolt killed their opponent"

	```lua
	
	-- Print a message if player's arrow killed its target
	local function onDamaged(e)
	    -- We only care if the player did the damage
	    if e.attackerReference ~= tes3.player then
	        return
	    end
	
	    -- Check if the damage was caused by a projectile, but not by a spell, so it must be an arrow or a bolt
	    if e.projectile ~= nil and e.magicSourceInstance == nil then
	
	        -- Did the damage kill the target?
	        if e.killingBlow == true then
	            tes3.messageBox("Your arrow felled its target!")
	        end
