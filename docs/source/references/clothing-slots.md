# Clothing Types

!!! tip
	These values are available in Lua by their identifier in the `tes3.clothingSlot.*` namespace. For example, `tes3.clothingSlot.rightGlove` has a value of `5`.

!!! note
	MWSE-mwscript's `xEquipmentList` returns this value as the subtype for clothing objects. These values are **increased by one** by that function.
