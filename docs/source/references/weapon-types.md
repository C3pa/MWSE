# Weapon Types

!!! tip
	These values are available in Lua by their identifier in the `tes3.weaponType.*` namespace. For example, `tes3.weaponType.longBladeTwoClose` has a value of `2`.

!!! note
	MWSE-mwscript's `xEquipmentList` returns this value as the subtype for weapon objects. These values are **increased by one** by that function.
