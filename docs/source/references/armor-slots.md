# Armor Types

!!! tip
	These values are available in Lua by their identifier in the `tes3.armorSlot.*` namespace. For example, `tes3.armorSlot.leftGauntlet` has a value of `6`.

!!! note
	MWSE-mwscript's `xEquipmentList` returns this value as the subtype for armor objects. These values are **increased by one** by that function.
